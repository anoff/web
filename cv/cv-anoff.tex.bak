\section{\color{blue}education}

\begin{entrylist}

\entry
{2017--2018}
{Artificial Intelligence {\normalfont Nanodegree}}
{Udacity}
{Pursuing a deeper understanding of AI fundamentals I chose to join the nanodegree program and improve my knowledge in game agents, probabilistics and other AI methods. In my third term I specialized in computer vision methods.}

\entry
{2017}
{Deep Learning {\normalfont Foundation Nanodegree}}
{Udacity}
{Intrigued and fascinated by the advances of artificial intelligence I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the topic and joined the class of Udacitys newly introduced Deep Learning program. Within the course I worked on several projects ranging from image recognition to generative networks.}

\entry
{2007--2010}
{Bachelor {\normalfont of Engineering,} 1.3}
{Hochschule Heilbronn, DE}
{With a grant from Bosch I studied different fields of mechatronics and microsystems engineering. For my thesis I analyzed the influence of advanced driver assistance systems on steering based driver monitoring systems. The main focus was on data analytics and combined Matlab with scientific knowledge.
}

\entry
{2005--2007}
{Mechatronics training}
{Robert Bosch GmbH, DE}
{During my vocational training with the IHK Heilbronn I learned the basics of engineering and how they relate to the physical world. The broad scope of topics covered in mechatronics also quickly made me realize my love for programming over the other possible fields in engineering.

\section{\color{green}interests}
\begin{itemize}
\item learning new technologies (blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics, deep learning)
\item share \& exchange knowledge on meetups/conferences
\item skiing, biking, diving
\item cooking

\section{\color{purple}side projects}
  \textit{A selection of my OSS projects. For more see my \href{https://github.com/anoff}{GitHub profile} or \href{https://anoff.io}{website}.}
  
  \project{plantbuddy}{https://github.com/anoff/plantbuddy/}{A fullstack IoT solution to monitor moisture levels in potted plants. Running an ESP8266 chip with WiFi connectivity to collect moisture data as well as temperature and humidity data near the plant. Data is collected four times per hour and sent to a serverless backend running on Google Firestore. The backend enriches the sensor data with local weather information from OpenWeatherMap. A single page webapp written with the VueJS framework shows the sensor readings on an interactive chart.}

  \project{devradar.io}{https://devradar.io}{Inspired by the \href{https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar}{Thoughtworks Technology Radar} I decided to build a website to keep track of my technological skills. So called blips represent skills in different categories like languages, frameworks or methods and place them on a radar indicating the skill level. In my free time I am working on improving this project to build an ecosystem for competence management of developers and development teams.}
