In 2020 I joined Bosch Japan in Yokohama as Digitalization Program Lead for Engineering, or as my boss called it: The Digitalization Dragon Slayer.
On the one hand I am leading the overall digitalization efforts in a consulting fashion on the other hand I am actively developing solutions for the area of Systems and Software engineering. My special focus is on automating previously manual tasks and creating data awareness.
My guiding principles for this job being: *It is not a humans job to replicate data from one system to another*

Before I worked as a solution architect for connected services in the domain of automated driving.
Working with technologies like Docker, GitLab, Azure Cloud, Node.js and implementing Infrastructure as Code, DDD and test driven principles allowed me to keep learning constantly - which is a huge motivation for me.
Besides creating solution architecture and implementing I was also deeply invested in the way our team worked together and how we bring business needs into implemented solutions.

In my free time I tinker around with Code and prototype my own IoT solutions.
I also enjoy building small side projects and collaborate on GitHub.
These private projects allow me to test out new concepts and bring them into my professional projects at some point.
You can read about some of my projects on the [projects category](/project/).
